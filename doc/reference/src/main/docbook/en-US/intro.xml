   <title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
      We believe that integration testing should be no more complex than writing a basic unit test. We created
      Arquillian to realize that goal. One of the major complaints we've heard about Seam 2 testing (i.e., SeamTest)
      was, not that it isn't possible, but that it isn't flexible and it's difficult to setup. We wanted to correct
      those shortcomings with Arquillian.
   </para>
   
   <para>
      Testing needs vary greatly, which is why it's so vital that, with Arquillian (and ShrinkWrap), we have decomposed
      the problem into its essential elements. The result is a completely flexible and portable integration testing
      framework.
   </para>
   
   <section id="mission">
      <title>Mission statement</title>
      <para>
         The mission of the Arquillian project is to provide a simple test harness that developers can use to produce a
         broad range of integration tests for their Java applications (most likely enterprise applications). A test case
         may be executed within the container, deployed alongside the code under test, or by coordinating with the
         container, acting as a client to the deployed code.
      </para>

      <para>
         Arquillian defines two styles of container, remote and embedded. A remote container resides in a separate JVM
         from the test runner. Its lifecycle may be managed by Arquillian, or Arquillian may bind to a container that is
         already started. An embedded container resides in the same JVM and is mostly likely managed by Arquillian.
         Containers can be further classified by their capabilities. Examples include a fully compliant Java EE
         application server (e.g., GlassFish, JBoss AS, Embedded GlassFish), a Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty)
         and a bean container (e.g., Weld SE). Arquillian ensures that the container used for testing is pluggable, so
         the developer is not locked into a proprietary testing environment.
      </para>
 
      <para>
         Arquillian seeks to minimize the burden on the developer to carry out integration testing by handling all
         aspects of test execution, including:

      <para>
         To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developer's build environment, Arquillian integrates
         transparently with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using
         existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins without any add-ons.
      </para>

         Arquillian makes integration testing a breeze.

   <section id="overview">
      <title>Architecture overview</title>
      <para>
         Arquillian combines a unit testing framework (JUnit or TestNG), ShrinkWrap, and one or more supported target
         containers (Java EE container, servlet container, Java SE CDI environment, etc) to provide a simple, flexible
         and pluggable integration testing environment.

      <para>
         At the core, Arquillian provides a <emphasis>custom test runner for JUnit and TestNG</emphasis> that turns
         control of the test execution lifecycle from the unit testing framework to Arquillian. From there, Arquillian
         can delegate to service providers to setup the environment to execute the tests inside or against the
         container. An Arquillian test case looks just like a regular JUnit or TestNG test case with two declarative
         enhancements, which will be covered later.
      </para>

      <para>
         Since Arquillian works by replacing the test runner, Arquillian tests can be executed using existing test IDE,
         Ant and Maven test plugins without any special configuration. Test results are reported just like you would
         expect. That's what we mean when we say using Arquillian is no more complicated than basic unit testing.
      </para>

      <para>
         At this point, it's appropriate to pause and define the three aspects of an Arquillian test case. This
         terminology will help you better understand the explainations of how Arquillian works.

      <para>
         The test case is dispatched to the container's environment through coordination with
         <emphasis>ShrinkWrap</emphasis>, which is used to declaratively define a custom Java EE archive that
         encapsulates the test class and its dependent resources. Arquillian packages the ShrinkWrap-defined archive at
         runtime and deploys it to the <emphasis>target container</emphasis>. It then negotiates the execution of the
         test methods and captures the test results using remote communication with the server. Finally, Arquillian
         undeploys the test archive. We'll go into more detail about how Arquillian works in a later chapter.
      </para>

      <para>
         So what is the target container? Some proprietary testing container that emulates the behavior of the technology
         (Java EE)? Nope, it's pluggable. It can be your actual target runtime, such as JBoss AS, GlassFish or Tomcat.
         It can even been an embedded container such as JBoss Embedded AS, GlassFish Embedded or Weld SE. All of this is
         made possible by a RPC-style (or local, if applicable) communication between the test runner and the
         environment, negotiating which tests are run, the execution, and communicating back the results. This means two
         things for the developer:

         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         With that in mind, let's consider where we are today with integration testing in Java EE and why an easy
         solution is needed.
      </para>

   </section>

   <!-- consider a chapter on Motivation or Benefits -->
   <section id="motivation">
      <title>Integration testing in Java EE</title>

      <para>
         Integration testing is very important in Java EE. The reason is two-fold:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>Business components often interact with resources or sub-system provided by the container</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Many declarative services get applied to the business component at runtime</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         The first reason is inherent in enterprise applications. For the application to perform any sort of meaningful
         work, it has to pull the strings on other components, resources (e.g., a database) or systems (e.g., a web
         service). Having to write any sort of test that requires an enterprise resource (database connection, entity
         manager, transaction, injection, etc) is a non-starter because the developer has no idea what to even use.
         Clearly there is a need for a simple solution, and Arquillian fills that void.
      </para>

      <para>
         Some might argue that, as of Java EE 5, the business logic performed by most Java EE components can now be
         tested outside of the container because they are POJOs. But let's not forget that in order to isolate the
         business logic in Java EE components from infrastructure services (transactions, security, etc), many of those
         services were pushed into declarative programming constructs. At some point you want to make sure that the
         infrastructure services are applied correctly and that the business logic functions properly within that
         context, justifying the second reason that integration testing is important in Java EE.
      </para>
      
      <section>
         <title>Testing the real component</title>

         <para>
            The reality is that you aren't really testing your component until you test it in situ. It's all to easy to
            create a test that puts on a good show but doesn't provide any real guarantee that the code under test
            functions properly in a production environment. The show typically involves mock components and/or bootstrapped
            environments that cater to the test. Such "unit tests" can't verify that the declarative services kick in as
            they should. While unit tests certainly have value in quickly testing algorithms and business calculations
            within methods, there still need to be tests that exercise the component as a complete service.
         </para>

         <para>
            Rather than instantiating component classes in the test using Java's new operator, which is customary in a unit
            test, Arquillian allows you to inject the container-managed instance of the component directly into your test
            class (or you can look it up in JNDI) so that you are testing the actual component, just as it runs inside the
            application.
         </para>
      </section>

      <section>
         <title>Finding a happy medium</title>
         <para>
            Do you really need to run the test in a real container when a Java SE CDI environment would do?
         </para>

         <para>
            It's true, some tests can work without a full container. For instance, you can run certain tests in a Java
            SE CDI environment with Arquillian. Let's call these "standalone" tests, whereas tests which do require a
            full container are called "integration" tests. Every standalone test can also be run as an integration test,
            but not the other way around. While the standalone tests don't need a full container, it's also important to
            run them as integration tests as a final check just to make sure that there is nothing they conflict with
            (or have side effects) when run in a real container.
         </para>

         <para>
            It might be a good strategy to make as many tests work in standalone mode as possible to ensure a quick test
            run, but ultimately you should consider running all of your tests in the target container. As a result, you'll
            likely enjoy a more robust code base.
         </para>

         <para>
            We've established that integration testing is important, but how can integration testing being accomplished
            without involving every class in the application? That's the benefit that ShrinkWrap brings to Arquillian.
         </para>
      </section>

      <section id="microdeployments">
         <title>Controlling the test classpath</title>
      
         <para>
            One huge advantage ShrinkWrap brings to Arquillian is classpath control. The classpath of a test run has
            traditionally been a kitchen sink of all production classes and resources with the test classes and resources
            layered on top. This can make the test run indeterministic, or it can just be hard to isolate test resources
            from the main resources.
         </para>

         <para>
            Arquillian uses ShrinkWrap to create "micro deployments" for each test, giving you fine-grained control over
            what you are testing and what resources are available at the time the test is executed. An archive can
            include classes, resources and libraries. This not only frees you from the classpath hell that typically
            haunts test runners (Eclipse, Maven), it also gives you the option to focus on the interaction between an
            subset of production classes, or to easily swap in alternative classes. Within that grouping you get the
            self-assembly of services provided by Java EE&#8212;the very integration which is being tested.
         </para>

      </section>

      <para>
         Let's move on and consider some typical usage scenarios for Arquillian.
      </para>

   </section>

   <section id="usage">
      <title>Usage scenarios</title>
      <para>
         With the strategy defined above, where the test case is executed in the container, you should get the sense of
         the freedom you have to test a broad range of situations that may have seemed unattainable when you only had
         the primitive unit testing environment. In fact, anything you can do in an application you can now do in your
         test class.
      </para>

      <para>
         A fairly common scenario is testing an EJB session bean. As you are inside the container, you can simply do a
         JNDI lookup to get the EJB reference and your test becomes a client of the EJB. But having to use JNDI to get
         a reference to the EJB is inconvenient (at least to Java EE 5 developers that have become accustomed to
         annotation-based dependency injection). Arquillian allows you to use the <literal>@EJB</literal> annotation to
         inject the reference to an EJB session bean into your test class.
      </para>

      <para>
         EJB session beans are one type of Java EE resource you may want to access. But that's just the beginning.
         You can access any resource available in a Java EE container, from a <literal>UserTransaction</literal> to
         a <literal>DataSource</literal> to a mail session. Any of these resources can be injected directly into
         your test class using the Java EE 5 <literal>@Resource</literal> annotation.
      </para>

      <para>
         Resource injections are convenient, but they are <emphasis>so</emphasis> Java EE 5. In Java EE 6, when you
         think dependency injection, you think JSR-299: CDI. Your test class can access any bean in the
         ShrinkWrap-defined archive, provided the archive contains a beans.xml file to make it a bean archive.  And you
         can inject bean instances directly into your class using the <literal>@Inject</literal> annotation, or you can
         inject an <literal>Instance</literal> reference to the bean, allowing you to create a bean instance when needed
         in the test. Of course, you can do anything else you can do with CDI within your test as well.
      </para>
         
      <para>
         Another important scenario in integration testing is performing data access. If the ShrinkWrap-defined archive 
         contains a persistence.xml descriptor, the persistence unit will be started when the archive is deployed
         and you can perform persistence operations. You can obtain a reference to an <literal>EntityManager</literal>
         by injecting it into your class with <literal>@PersistenceContext</literal> or from a CDI producer-field.
         Alternatively, you can execute the persistence operation indirectly through an EJB session bean or a managed bean.
      </para>

      <!-- eliminate burden of packaging using build -->

      <para>
         Those examples should give you an idea of some of the tasks that are possible from within an
         Arquillian-enhanced test case. Now that you have plenty of motivation for using Arquillian, let's
         look at how to get started using Arquillian.
